        While (maybe) other developers usually would build a traditional webpage
        with router system to display both the leaderboard and the game market
        which is totally fine and it works for 99% of the cases, I decided to be
        a little riskier and try to build a more interactive experience for the
        user. so I made this "game-like" experience where the user can open and
        close windows. Also since the interaction with the API feels like using
        an 80s/90s Atari console üéÆ, I decided to give the project this "retro
        style" similar to an old Windows 95 machine.
